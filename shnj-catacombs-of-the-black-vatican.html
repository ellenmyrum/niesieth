Catacombs of the Black Vatican. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better. Got this album a few days ago and I've listened to it a few times. So far I don't think it's as good as Order of the Black (which I consider their best album since the Blessed Hellride), but still entertaining. One interesting thing about this album is that some of the songs have almost an Alice in Chains alt-metal One benefit of being an established veteran band is that you know your audience likes what you do, so if you stick to what comes naturally it'll be enough to satisfy

My biggest complaint-and a minor one at that-is the drum work. Shaun does a good job covering the stuff Chad and Jeremy did, but the new stuff lacks a lot of anything interesting. I really miss Chad’s unique fills and rhythms, and cymbal work. Even Jeremy had some interesting drum work on his albums. Not bashing Shaun at all. He’s a solid drummer. I’m just saying that it’s amazing how much Chad added to the music. Heck, even compare the drum tracks on the Catacombs of the Black Vatican.

Perhaps I know. I’m walking down a path few if any have walked down. Maybe years and years from now, long after the Void takes me. Someone like me will find and read this.
