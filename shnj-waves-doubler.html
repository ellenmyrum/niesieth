If you look at (a), for positive wave, a diode is placed before a capacitor. But for negative wave, a capacitor is placed before the diode. Why is that? Or am I thinking about this incorrectly.

Why is that? Or am I thinking about this incorrectly? EDIT: It's supposed to be AC Full Wave Voltage Doubler. It could just be my voice, but here's the attempted mix. https://instaud.io/2xQO And here's the vocals on their own: https://instaud.io/2xQT On the vocals I have: 1. EQ 2. Compressor 3. Desser 4. Exciter 5. Noise gate And then I'm bussing that to 6. Waves doubler (cranked up during the chorus) 7. Soft plate reverb 8. Tape delay I'm trying to reproduce it as the original as possible here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7MFYoylVs, but I just feel like I'm missing something. I've always recorded a guitar two times, and panned them left and right. It works very well with simple strumming but with finger picking it can get messy unless there are two perfect takes. And I really struggle with getting ONE perfect take. I know a professional producer and he said told me that if I want a really clean uncomplicated guitar sound, I should just use a stereo delay (0ms/15ms), or copy the track and put one of the tracks in around 15 ms delay Now I can't Hi, In the spirit of trying to encourage discussion and participating in the sub, I'm going to start trying to do AMAs about my tracks. Essentially if there is anything you want to know about anything on this track, I will tell you. Here is the track: Tension (https://soundcloud.com/marcus00/tension) I don't claim to be the best musician or an expert by any means, but I thought it'd be cool to get a conversation going. I will open by giving you a breakdown of the track: Intro:. Ive been listening to MTNS (https://soundcloud.com/mtnsmusic), they're my case study for the "indie sound" ~~I've noticed so far it's very reverb heavy and there's lots of delay. the music is very simple, 2 instruments, a bass, drums and vocals. However, there's so much attention to detail and it is so heavily processed that i just can't do it with my experience. I know there are lots of EDM, trap, ect kinda tutorials out there i'm just wondering if there are any tutorials on youtube I'm going to work on a PT HD rig this week (I do Cubase, so that should be fun in and of itself). One of the main reasons I want to work on this guys stuff is that there are tons of vocals, I very seldom get to mix stuff with vox (publishing libraries) but I have a few 'go to's' that I won't be able to use. When asked what plug ins he uses, he replied "The UAD ones". When asked 'which ones' he said "ALL of them". So. I like to take two duplicates of the stack 
What pedal/fx rack or computer do you use to double the vocals in a live scenario? I could be wrong but a band Meytal that I watched seemed to use the waves doubler plugin live. I've also seen the VoiceLive 3 by TC Helicon. I noticed recently that the primary compatibility problem with my mixes might be the stereo image. I noticed that different supposedly-stereo sound systems have varying degrees of stereo: (1) My car retains both L and R, but sometimes loses some R, and cancels very wide sounds. (2) My laptop's headphone jack has some L/R bleed i.e. a full-right pan might still leak into the L speaker . (3) Digital mono seems totally different than hardware-mono, as digital is more prone to what I believe I dropped this over at r/WeAreTheMusicMakers also: I've been looking into ways to fatten up my choruses so I wanted to do a 3d-surround type effect. A similar effect can be heard on Kendrick's "Money Trees" adlibs ("ya bish" and other end words) and on the hook: There's a noticeable 3Dness to it, more so then a hard pan left a right can create. The closest I got to this effect is do a main vocal down the middle, do a take hard panned I've been looking into ways to fatten up my choruses so I wanted to do a 3d-surround type effect.

Hey all, Been lurking for a while and using ableton for six months. I am halfway done with the second song on an EP I am working on and I have run into a few walls. I was wondering if anyone had any advice. Here is a link to the private track on soundcloud. Let me know if it works because I will feel super dumb posting this if it doesn't. https://soundcloud.com/mankindrc/alone-plus-vocals/s-fCCiO 1. I can't seem to get my vocals any fatter than they are right Hey guys, I’m a hiphop artist who’s style resembles post Malone in some ways. Particularly on my vocals. I just got a huge bundle of waves plugins to mix my vocals much better. I’m wondering if anyone has an idea of what they think post Malone’s (Louis bells) vocal chain is. I know In an interview Louis bell states his usage of some UA plugins, but I’m wondering if I can get similar effects with certain waves plugins. If you know any that produce that distinct warm, wide vocal like post malone.

Favorites? Unconventional uses for different plug-ins? Thanks. My vocal chain consists of de-esser, subtractive eq, autotune, hard compressor, additive eq, two more light compressors, saturation, and a doubler. Reverb and delay on sends. I mostly use Waves plugins. (Ren eq, c4 compressor, and renvox) I think my chain is alright but I still feel like I'm lacking a pro sound. Post your vocal chain below, with links if possible. Full wave voltage doubler magnetron power supply modification that can be applied to existing magnetron power supplies to eliminate the existing pulsed half wave DC output. Should reduce the maggie's output frequency spectrum spread and to allow rough maggie freq adjustment. How does James Fauntleroy get his vocal sound? It's some kind of phaser or something.
